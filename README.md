## University Students’ Burnout Data Analysis

This project was carried out as part of the NewTech Academy Data Analysis track using Python, and it represents my first practical application in the field of data analysis.

## Project Idea
The project aims to study burnout levels among university students and analyze their relationship with several potential factors, including:

Academic year

Gender

Study hours

GPA

## Tools and Technologies Used
The following tools and environments were used to perform the analysis:

Python with libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Google Colab for running code and analyzing data

## Methodology
A systematic data analysis methodology was followed, including the following stages:

Data Exploration
Descriptive statistics were used to understand the overall structure of the data, such as mean and standard deviation.

Data Cleaning
Duplicate, missing, or incorrect values were handled to ensure data quality and accuracy.

Quantitative & Comparative Analysis
Relationships between burnout levels and other variables were analyzed using quantitative analysis tools.

Data Visualization
Graphs were created to illustrate differences between groups based on gender, academic year, study hours, and GPA.

## Key Findings

Female students show higher burnout levels compared to male students.

Second- and third-year students experience higher burnout levels than students in other years.

There is a correlation between study hours, GPA, and burnout levels.
